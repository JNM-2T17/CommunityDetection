If we allow a bakeshop to deny services, do we then allow hospitals etc to discriminate? #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that the principle of non discrimination is what is common and relevant. #PassADB", "Sen Pimentel asks why the case is being used when the bill is not pattered after Colorado law. Suggests using a different example. #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that the owner would not be coerced to produce the cake, what the bill penalizes is the denial of services #PassADB", "Sen Villanueva goes back to bakeshop owner example. Can we require the person to do something against his religious belief? #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that intent is needed. If there is no intent, no crime committed. #PassADB", "Sen Pimentel: How will a person know he is dealing with a queer? If queerness is an attitude, it is all in the mind. #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that there are anti discrimination ordinances in the ph, yet in these places no complaint of abuses recorded. #PassADB", "Sen Sotto: we should also put in the law what are external manefestation of being queer. People might exploit the provisions #PassADB", "Sen Risa says that in the dictionary, straight means two points connected by a line. Yet we use this term to identify. #PassADB", "Sen Sotto says that this bill is creating a new dictionary. Why should we make a new definition of queer? #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that the dictionary definition of queer is not what queer in the bill means. It's how people identify themselves #PassADB", "Sen Villanueva says that if someone calls him queer, he would be offended. #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that it is up to the person to define themselves as queer, we cannot out anyone. #PassADB", "Sen Sotto: for a layman, para mas madali, can you give an example of a queer? Is Sen Honasan queer? *laughs* #PassADB", "Sen Pimentel asks what queer means? Intersex? The law should define these terms. Sen Risa accepts and agrees. #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that the bill can be used to protect everyone who would be discriminated against on the basis of whatever SOGIE. #PassADB", "Sen Pimentel why claim that this bill is for everyone when it is focused on protecting the LGBT. #PassADB", "Sen Risa explains that SOGIE is an aspect of every individual/identity. #PassADB", "Sen Pimentel asks if this is an ADB for everyone, why focus on SOGIE? #PassADB", "Sen Risa asserts that different discriminatory bases requires different protective frameworks. #PassADB", "There has to be a SOGIE based ADB other than comprehensive ADB bec these have different bases of discrimination. #PassADB", "Sen Risa: the SOGIE based ADB is for all, may therefore be invoked by a straight man should he be discriminated for being straight. #PassADB", "Sen Pimentel asks if everyone has SOGIE, why not just make anti discrimination law for everyone?

The bill does not talk about same sex marriage. #PassADB", "... the cake vendor would be penalized. How does that respect religious freedom? #PassADB", "Sen Villanueva reiterates the concept of religious freedom.

Freedom of religion would remain to be upheld. #PassADB", "Sen Villanueva mentions religious freedom as an example. #PassADB", "She couldnt accept that certain rights granted to certain groups would have the intent of discriminating others based on SOGIE #PassADB", "Sen Hontiveros explains that she could not accept such amendment because it goes against the principle of the bill. #PassADB", "Sen Hontiveros answers that the SOGIE is an expanded classification and includes straight men and women. #PassADB", "Sen Villanueva asks if the author is amenable to include a provision saying that other rights would not be prejudiced. #PassADB", "Sen Hontiveros: Sex in this bill means the binary classification.
